```

### Tesla

Tesla requires [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.tesla.com/support/multi-factor-authentication).

#### EVCC configuration

You need to create access and refresh tokens to the Tesla API. One way to generate them is starting EVCC with the parameter "tesla-token". This cannot be done using the Docker image. Please use Windows or Linux instead. After entering your tesla.com username and password, EVCC will open a browser window and display a CAPTCHA. The code needs to be entered when requested and the tokens will be displayed. Once added to the configuration as detailed below, EVCC will request new tokens automatically.

Example configuration:

```yaml
vehicle:
- name: tesla
  type: tesla
  title: Model 3 # title of your car
  capacity: 79 # kWh
  tokens:
    access: # generated by running "evcc tesla-token" once
    refresh: # generated by running "evcc tesla-token" once
  vin: # the VIN of your car (can be obtained from Tesla website)
  cache: 5m
```

### Renault

Example configuration:
```yaml
vehicle:
-  name: renault
   type: renault
   title: Zoe # title of your car
   capacity: 22 # kWh , replace with your vehicles capacity
